<h2 class="post-title">Pay With Venmo</h2>

<p>
    As the parent company of Venmo, PayPal wanted the ability for Venmo users to complete checkout transactions using their Venmo account as a funding source.
</p>
<p>
    For this to occur, the user must be able to authorize the transaction in their Venmo app. We do this by generating an app-specific url which will launch the Venmo app on the user's device in a way that allows it to interact with a Firebase backend which manages the state & relationship between the particular PayPal Checkout SDK being used and the app, regarding the transaction that is currently in the process of being authorized. 
</p>
<p>
    In the event that the checkout process is occurring in an environment where the Venmo app isn't available (such as on desktop), we generate a QR Code which is readable by the Venmo app and launches the authorization flow for that transaction. 
</p>
<p>
    Finally, all of <a href="https://github.com/paypal/paypal-smart-payment-buttons/pull/158/files" rel="noreferrer">this built out functionality</a> needed to be <a href="https://github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components/pull/1632/files" rel="noreferrer">integrated</a> into the broader <a href="https://github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components" rel="noreferrer">PayPal Checkout Web SDK</a>, enabling it to be run in a cross-domain manner. 
</p>
<p>
    I served as the primary developer and point of contact for the Checkout Integrations team, building out the web implementation portions of the solution.
