[this is correct](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/414271/)...  

The semantic use of the word aside, I think the takeaway should be that software development as a profession needs to start to think about becoming more formal and standardized in some ways. 

There are systemic educational and licensing processes in place that ensure that those who are civil,structural,mechanical,etc. engineers have a minimum level of competency. This makes sense because when they mess up, people die. This is also why the rate of catastrophic engineering failures in the U.S. is like 1 every 10-20 years. 

Software development doesn't have that. It's actually the polar opposite as it is a profession that is disproportionately lucrative in relation to the formal education/certification required to participate in relation to most other career paths. Even those that have the formal credentials of a CS degree leave school with widely varying degrees of competency. 

This isn't inherently an issue when the largest consequences of a catastrophic failure is just that somebody loses a fuck-ton of money. 

It starts to become a problem when software becomes integrated into systems that have catastrophic failure states that mirror that of a bridge collapsing.
