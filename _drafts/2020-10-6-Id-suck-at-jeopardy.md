that podcase reminded me...



so here's the thing....I pride myself on have an incredibly good handle on random triva....

[originally 23 minute mark assuming first break?}

the problem occurs at the 16 minute mark. When Alec makes his money, by interacting with the contestants.  He reads his card that has prepared anecdotes about them....
the problem is that I don't have any anecdotes. being from iowa isn't unique, also I don't know that I identifiy in that way, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


I had them: 

"He works for a shark-tank startup" 
"He coaches a youth soccer team"
"he works for the Onion"

....and now... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


unfortunately, 
"living the north part of river north"
"works for credit-card processor"
"being the only person awake at 4am to call in a some guy who decided he should jump from one of the hgher levels of his 50 story apt. building"
"being the only person awake at 4am to call in a jumper from his building....



don't really translate well to game show chit-chat.


So i guess I need a hobby....



....being fucking dope is so goddamn time consuming thought....










Futher, it becomes problem with dating....
like...I'm not interesting 




since then:
