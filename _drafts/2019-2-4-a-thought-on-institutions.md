> I've never understood the notion of being loyal to an institution. An institution is an inanimate legal construct filed in Delaware. You should be loyal to people. But when I see people talk about making career decisions, over their loyalty to institutions I feel that's a construct that's been built into our society mostly so young people would go put themselves in harms way to maintain the land of older rich people, but this notion of being loyal to a institution, it just doesn't make any sense to me...You should be loyal to people that treat you will. The institution does not exist. It's not going to take care of you when you're dying.
