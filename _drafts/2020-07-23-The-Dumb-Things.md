...oh hello. 



Being smart is actually a fairly big problem. 

> Smart people generally remain more vulnerable to their biases than the rest of the population...intelligence makes us more self-righteous, and less self-aware: "The smarter you are, the better you are at constructing a narrative that supports your beliefs, rationalizing and framing the data to fit your argument or point of view."

### #13 Trying to Time the Market  
- Timing the market is absurdly difficult to do. You basically have to be right twice. Not only do you have to time selling prior to a drop, but also have to time when to renter a rising market. 
"The attempt to avoid losing money in bear markets. The most common result, however, is to avoid making money in a bull markets" ~ Jason Zweig in [The Devil's Financial Dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/Devils-Financial-Dictionary-Jason-Zweig/dp/1610397762)
- It's a good rule not to take investment advice from friends, relatives, or colleagues, hover well-intentioned they might be...they probably don't know what they're talking about. Try not to blindly trust people you know in *any* situation. Trust but verify. You are entitled to ask uncomfortable questions, even of people to whom you feel close. 
- Professional money mangers are garbage
    + They are timing the market. As of 2017, the S&P 500 yielded a twenty-year return of 7.68% vs equity fund investors that averaged 4.79%. [This widely understood](https://web.archive.org/web/20190117120707/http://cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v51.n1.1865).
    + "One of the single hardest things any investor can do is not to pick securities that will outperform the market, but to pick *the manager* who can pick securities that will out perform the market" - [Jason Zweig](https://www.jillonmoney.com/blog/ep-010-become-intelligent-investor-jason-zweig-part-two)
- Regularly rebalance your accounts. It forces you to sell high and buy low.
