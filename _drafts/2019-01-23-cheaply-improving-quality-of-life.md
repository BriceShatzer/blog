As a technologist, it's easy to take for granted the relatively simple things that [we know or are capable of doing](https://youtu.be/vUN7yu7zvz8?t=21). 

*example: Teacher entering numeric grades using the mouse rather than the num-pad on her keyboard.* 

When working with non-technical people, especially in fields that aren't generally considered very technically-enabled, this disconnect can be even more larger. 

You can do fairly basic things that can result in exponential efficiency gains. 


### Speadsheets 
If you even have a basic understanding of software development, you're already one of the better spreadsheet users you work with.

### Generate Links to URLs that are helpful

Look for [urls that allow you to do stuff](http://alexpounds.com/blog/2018/12/29/four-cool-urls).  

I used a the established search pattern that GitHub uses in their urls to add a adding a [Feature Switch Search link](https://changelog.kinja.com/quickly-find-feature-switches-in-github-1821016295) to our dashboard management page for those values.

### Basic Web Apps 
While the idea of throwing together a simple web app to help somebody do their job might seem daunting, remember this is what 90% of web development is:

Look for existing infrastructure that does what you want, and then ducktape over the parts you don't need.
