General React trivia, which I did poorly on. Specifically, I didn't know...  
- that `PropTypes` [was a thing](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) 
(probably because it hasn't actually been a part of React since [2017](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1550-april-7-2017) ‡≤†_‡≤†) 
- or had ever heard of/used `React.PureComponent`. 
I've always . React had a built in

## Microsoft / Flipgrid  
**Who?:** [They](https://info.flipgrid.com/) are a video sharing/learning platform. They're basically Snapchat but specifically for use in the classroom.

**Job:** [Software Engineer II](https://web.archive.org/save/https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/827068/Software-Engineer-II)  
**Source:** [Hired](https://hired.com/x/4g305)  
**Process:**  
    - Initial call with Microsoft recruiter  
    - Video call with front-end dev & senior lead dev 
    - Asked to complete a [coding assignment](https://github.com/BriceShatzer/Flipgrid-Code-Challenge)

**What Happened?:** Rejected because of deficiencies in the project that I [submitted](https://briceshatzer.com/Flipgrid-Code-Challenge/). The feedback I received:  
>‚ÄúWe appreciated him hosting it on his own site, his inclusion of tests, and creative "Reset Form" button using the Flipgrid logo! Stylistically there were a few deviations from the design (like Button height, colors, and shadow characteristics are incorrect; Focus outlines disabled and not replaced with an accessible substitute; etc) and code wise (for example: the form was missing a <form> element, Entire form (including headings, text, and button) re-renders on each keystroke in each input field).‚Äù   

While most of the "deviations" from the design stemmed from copying the styling they were using on their sites and the lack of a `<Form/>` seems immaterial given the application's functionality, the critique around the "re-rendering" is fair. In retrospect, I didn't have to write this using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and if I would've just used static HTML & vanilla javascript to handle the interactivity, I could have avoided a lot of the issues they mentioned. 


## Rheaply 
**Who?:** [They](https://www.rheaply.com/) build software that handles the management & exchange physical assets. Think stuff like lab equipment shared across a university system.  
**Job:** [Front End Engineer](/blog/assets/post-files/2020-06-11-job-search/Rheaply-Frontend_Engineer.pdf) | [Senior Engineer](/blog/assets/post-files/2020-06-11-job-search/Rheaply-Senior_Software_Engineer.pdf)  
**Source:** 3rd party recruiter  
**Process:**  
  - Initial call w/ Chief Product Officer  
  - Virtual "on-site" with 4 different people over 4 hours, and a virtual lunch break with the team. They even provided a digital GrubHub gift card which I thought was an incredibly thoughtful touch. üòÑ   

**What Happened?:** 
The majority of the on-site questions where very much in the ["Amazon behavioral-based"](/blog/assets/post-files/2020-06-11-job-search/AmazonSTAR.pdf#page=2) realm. Since I'd been prepping for those sort of questions, I felt I answered them all fairly well.  

When the opportunity was discussed with me initially via the recruiter I was working with, there were two roles that they were looking to hire for: a [front end](/blog/assets/post-files/2020-06-11-job-search/Rheaply-Frontend_Engineer.pdf) role & [senior full stack](/blog/assets/post-files/2020-06-11-job-search/Rheaply-Senior_Software_Engineer.pdf) role. While I consider myself a competent full stack developer, my core-competency resides in building UIs. I learned through the interview process that they had already hired someone for the front end role and were looking specifically for someone to fill the full stack role, and ideally relieve the CTO of a lot of his day-to-day development work. The final interview of the on-site was with said CTO. I got through the non-technical questions he asked, but probably could have been stronger/faster the live coding portion, which was fairly generic (`leetcode.com/problems/random-one-question`) and had something to do with arrays & strings or something if I remember correctly. I got a solution but he certainly didn't seem impressed, asking "how much did you have to look up while doing this?" ...none, but does it matter? lol   
Ultimately, they decided I wasn't what they were looking for.

    "All of the sites look the same", had been a consistent refrain that the product team has heard from both the editorial staff and readers throughout the life of Kinja, and only intensified when the brands of Onion, Inc. <a href="https://product.kinja.com/the-onion-is-now-publishing-on-kinja-1819619421" rel="noreferrer">migrated on to the platform</a>.
</p>
<p>
    With that in mind, we set about creating a new way for the different sites to be able to express their own unique and creative brand identities without having to rely on time from the product team. The ability to completely customize headers on any different category, story type, vertical (sub-site) page is available from within Kinja's internal management UI, <a href="https://changelog.kinja.com/added-ability-to-customize-curation-module-1840391541" rel="noreferrer">which all site editors</a> have access to.  
</p>
<p>
    Some great examples of the editorial staff taking full advantage of the project can be found on the Gizmodo sub-sites like <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/" rel="noreferrer">Paleofuture</a>, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/" rel="noreferrer">io9</a>, & <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/" rel="noreferrer">Earther</a>; and the various sections of The A.V. Club:  <a href="https://film.avclub.com/" rel="noreferrer">Film</a>, <a href="https://tv.avclub.com/" rel="noreferrer">T.V.</a>, <a href="https://music.avclub.com/" rel="noreferrer">Music</a>, <a href="https://games.avclub.com/" rel="noreferrer">Games</a>, & <a href="https://aux.avclub.com/" rel="noreferrer">AUX</a>.
