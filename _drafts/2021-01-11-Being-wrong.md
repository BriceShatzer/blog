Given that man's space flight aspirations were born out of cold war rivalries leading to the space race (a race we [objectively loss](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2019/07/19/who-really-won-space-race.html)), it's not crazy to think that the possibility of hostilities weren't a consideration. 


I watched this [video](https://youtu.be/QlTf5X0MKbg), I got to thinking... 

in theory, wouldn't it make a ton of sense for the United States to make it a point to  
 a) always have some sort of someone that is capable of being a combatant as part of their contingent on the ISS
 b) train that person in zero-g hand-to-hand combat techniques 


 Zero-G hand-to-hand combat isn't crazy far fetched. 

 Picard, Worf, & some guy sort of do it in [First Contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ljpC9DYPo)
