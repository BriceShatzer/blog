<br />

Hi, I'm [Brice](https://www.briceshatzer.com) and I'm a Chicago-based software engineer that specializes in front-end web development. 

As a life-long gamer, I've always been familiar with Chicago's [historical relevance](https://www.insertcoindoc.com/) & continued [impact](https://bitbashchicago.com/) on the world of game development, and in moving to the city after college, I entertained fleeting notions of having the chance to contribute to an industry that has provided so much joy & enrichment throughout my life. As my professional talents coalesced around front-end web development, I accepted the fact that my particular skills-set would likely never translate into the game development world and it's ubiquitous use of C-based languages.  

You can understand my excitement when I came across a job posting for a front-end developer at a game studio in Chicago! üòç  

This excitement was further compounded by the fact that the game studio was Jackbox Games. One of my earliest PC gaming memories was playing through "You Don't Know Jack" back in the 90's and letting the credits roll in order to listen to all the [commercials](https://youtu.be/NTBBRcUIEEI?t=23s), and more recently, watching your games be played on stream ([LoadingReadyRun](https://youtu.be/AR3AgOzwS_E) in particular) & using them as a way to stay connected to friends & co-workers throughout the pandemic, has been absolutely delightful.  


In terms of my favorite game, the [collective 1,548 hours](https://steamcommunity.com/id/briceshatzer/games/?tab=all) I've spent playing the various iterations of the Sid Meier's Civilization series makes a fairly compelling quantitative argument. That being said, over the past handful of years I would have to say that my favorite game has been [Magic: The Gathering](https://www.magic.gg/), for two distinct reasons:  

- First, it's vast intricacies and ever-shifting game play environment creates an incredibly compelling puzzle to be solved, and I'm consistently left with the feeling that just one more tweak or change could finally be the key. 

- Second, (and perhaps most importantly) I've meet some of my best friends through the game and it continues to served as an excuse to see some of my favorite people. Life inevitably happens with folks moving, starting families, etc., but we've all made it a point to travel to at least one of the larger regional events that occur throughout the year in order to meet up. Generally this involves all of us staying in a rental house for the weekend, playing a ton of Magic both at the event & at home, and going to Benihana for some reason. 





<br />
I'm excited to hopefully have a conversation about what I could potentially bring to Jackbox Games.
